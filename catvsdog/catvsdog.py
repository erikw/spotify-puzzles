""""
Determine the subset of dogs and cats that gets to stay in the program to maximize view vote satisfaction.

1. Draw the "conflict graph" G_c = V, E, with V = set of votes, E = edge between every votes that has a conflict in choice.
2. We're interested in the complement of G_c, the compatible graph G_cmpat where and edge represents a non-conflict between two votes. In G_cmpat we want to find the largest connected component that is complete i.e. the largest subset of verticies that are all connected directly to each other.
3. Constructing G_compat from G_c takes extra time so we extract this number from G_c. By studying examples we see that the number we want from G_cmpat is |V| - (min vertex cover) in G_c. Min vertex cover is a hard problem but luckily G_c is bipartite (since each vote must contain 1 dog and 1 cat, therefore in an example of 3 votes, G_c could look like v1-v2-v3 but an edge from v1 to v3 could not exist for this 1dog1cat-reason). The bipartiteness enables us to use the KÃ¶ning's theorem which states equivalence between min vertex cover and maximum edge matching in bipartite graphs.
4. Thus return as answer |V| - maxedgematch(G_c), which can be done with Network Flow. However the best algo seems to be Hopcroft-Karp's, so lets use that one.
